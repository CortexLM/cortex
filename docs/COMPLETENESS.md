# Cortex completeness matrix

Honest per-component status as of `main` HEAD. Updated as phases land.

## Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **done** | Implemented, tested, wired into a running binary. |
| **sim** | Code exists and passes tests, but the running binary uses a simulated backend, not live data. |
| **lib-only** | Library crate is complete; no binary drives it in production. |
| **stub** | Trait method returns `NotImplemented`; placeholder for future wiring. |
| **test-only** | Compiled and exercised by tests; deliberately unreachable from any shipped binary. |
| **missing** | No code, no compose service, no CI image. |

## Chain layer

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `ChainClient` trait | done | 14 methods, full trait surface. |
| `FakeChain` | test-only | Deterministic in-memory. No longer reachable from any binary; used by unit and adversarial tests. |
| `NotImplementedChain` | stub | Every method returns `Err(NotImplemented)`. |
| `LiveRpcChain` (feature `live` on older chain helpers) | stub | Legacy stub surface: `current_block` + `block_hash` only; metagraph / weight submit paths `NotImplemented`. **Not** the production backend. |
| `chain-live` crate (`LiveChainClient`) | **done** | Production chain client: full JSON-RPC reads (`Identity` hasher, `Keys` double-map enumeration, `ValueQuery` defaults) + sr25519 signed `set_weights` / `commit_timelocked_mechanism_weights`. The **only** backend in `bins/validator` and `bins/gateway`; both fail fast if the chain is unreachable. Four `#[ignore]` tests read live testnet 541. Do not confuse with stub `LiveRpcChain` above. |
| `BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINT` / `BASE_CHAIN_ENDPOINTS` | done | Read by `config::Config`; consumed by `chain-live::LiveChainClient::connect`. The plural var is an ordered comma-separated failover list (wins over the singular); a rate-limited (HTTP 429 / `-32005`) or unreachable endpoint cools 60s and the call tries the next in order. |
| CRV4 tlock encryption | **done** | Drand Quicknet TLE via git-pinned `tle` (same rev as subtensor / `bittensor_drand`); `LiveChainClient::submit_timelocked_weights` encrypts SCALE `WeightsTlockPayload` before signing. Fail-closed on encrypt error — never downgrades to `set_weights` while CR is enabled. |

## Validator

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`) | done | |
| Attestation (`/v1/attest/*`) | done | Real Intel DCAP via `dcap-qvl` when built `--features dcap` (the container default). Verified against live Intel PCS; a tampered quote yields `CryptoInvalid`. Mock verifiers remain for tests only. |
| Bundle fetch + `compare_bundle` | done | Continuous coordination loop. |
| Match → `submit_intent` | done | `spawn_coordination_loop` submits on Match with per-epoch in-memory dedupe; CR enabled → timelocked path (never downgrades to `set_weights`). Requires validator signing key. Last verified seal is persisted (`BASE_VALIDATOR_LKG_PATH`, default `/var/lib/base/last-sealed.bundle`) so a gateway burn fallback after master restart still Matches and submits. |
| `set_weights` / `submit_timelocked_weights` | done | Live `set_weights` (CR off) + `commit_timelocked_mechanism_weights` with Drand TLE ciphertext (CR on / CRV4). Signing key via `keystore`. |
| Chain backend | done | Live only. `FakeChain` was removed from `bins/validator`; there is no switch left to misconfigure. |

## Gateway

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Master check (`SubnetOwnerHotkey`) | done | Read from the live chain. Advisory by default; `BASE_GATEWAY_REQUIRE_OWNER=1` makes it fail-closed (set in staging). |
| Registry + proxy | done | |
| Bundle seal (`POST /v1/weights/raw` → `GET /v1/weights/latest`) | done | Unsealed: fail-closed burn (`sealed: false`, uid 0 = 100%) instead of 404. |
| Chain backend | done | Live only. `fake_owner` was removed from `bins/gateway`. |

## agent-challenge / hypertraining-challenge

Removed (replaced by design + prism HTTP paths; no Phala/CVM miner).

## design-challenge

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Crates (`crates/design-*`) | done | task, harness, prompts, sandbox, sanitize, store, egress-proxy, challenge. Elo lives in `design_rating` Postgres via `design-db` / `design-store-pg` — not a standalone crate. |
| Binary (`bins/design-challenge`) | done | HTTP API on `:8093`. |
| Binary (`bins/design-egress-proxy`) | done | Open egress proxy (internal blocklist) + budgeted LLM path. |
| Spec + checklist | done | [`DESIGN_CHALLENGE.md`](DESIGN_CHALLENGE.md) + checklist; `xtask design-check`. |
| Compose / images | in progress | deploy-wiring todo (port `28093` local). |
| Emission | **0 bps** | Prism 100% (10000 bps; sum `10000`). |

## prism-challenge

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Crate (`crates/prism-challenge`) | done | Lium client + sim backend + pipeline. |
| Binary (`bins/prism-challenge`) | done | Health + submit on `:8092`. |
| Compose service | done | Added to `docker-compose.yml` on `:8092`. |
| Dockerfile target | done | `deploy/Dockerfile` target `prism-challenge`. |
| GHCR image | done | Added to `images.yml` matrix and `ghcr-public.yml`. |
| Emission | **10000 bps** | Prism 100% (sum `10000`). |

## Infrastructure

Agent/operator contracts: root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), [`deploy/AGENTS.md`](../deploy/AGENTS.md), [`docs/AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Deploy detail remains in [`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md).

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Terraform droplets | done | 4 of 4: staging master, staging validator, prod master, prod validator. |
| Staging master | done | Migrated to `/opt/base` CI-managed; old `/opt/gbase` stack torn down. |
| Staging validator | done | Redeployed from same commit; `bundle gateway signature invalid` resolved. |
| Prod master | pending | Droplet up, awaiting the mainnet owner wallet and the first `v*.*.*` tag. |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | done | Auto on CI green; `--build-from source` for fast iteration; fail-closed health gate. |
| `deploy-prod.yml` | done | Tag-based (`v*.*.*`); preflight (CI green + `origin/main` staging pins `commit_sha`); fail-closed Spaces backup; `promote.sh --confirm-prod`; `--build-from registry` (GHCR digest pull, no Rust compile on droplet). |
| `images.yml` pin ladder | done | After GHCR push: write `deploy/digests/<sha>.json`, `promote.sh --env staging` for pin services, commit/push so prod preflight can match. |
| GitHub secrets | done | Host/SSH/gateway secrets set. Prod promote also needs Spaces: `BASE_BACKUP_ENDPOINT`, `SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (fail-closed if absent). |

## Keys and identity

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `keystore` crate | done | BIP39 (pinned 2048-word English list) → Substrate `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512(entropy, "mnemonic"+password, 2048)` → sr25519. Cross-checked against `substrateinterface` and against all six local wallets. |
| Bittensor wallet reader | done | Reads `~/.bittensor/wallets/<name>/hotkeys/<hotkey>`; re-derives the key and rejects the file if the derived public key disagrees with the stored one. |
| Hotkey resolution | done | `keystore::resolve_*_from_env`: wallet → mnemonic file → secret-key file → public-only hex/SS58. A mnemonic is never read from a plain env var. |
| Gateway / validator hotkeys | done | Both resolve from `BASE_*_WALLET`. Staging uses `base-owner` (gateway) and `base-validator`. |
| Wallets on hosts | done | Only the hotkey file is shipped, mode 0400, owned by uid 65532, under `deploy/secrets/wallets/`. |

## Challenge backends

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| design harness / sandbox | done | Two-phase Docker + `SimSandbox`; `base_design` SDK injected; sanitize + CSP viewer. |
| design rating / elimination | done | Integer Elo (K=32), bottom 20% / 4-round cooldown, exact-E leaves. |
| design API | done | Harness/quota/runs/viewer/annotate/ops on `:8093`. |
| prism Lium backend | done | `PRISM_FORCE_SIM=false` in staging; the binary logs `eval_backend=lium`. API key is mounted from a file so it never appears in `docker inspect`. |
| prism orchestration | done | DB-backed claim/execute/review/similarity/score state machine (`prism_submission` + append-only `prism_stage_event`), pre-pod screens (copy gate + static cheat + AST similarity) before Lium rent, sweeper (10h grace + pre-reclaim log harvest; skips live workers), **detached harness + resume-first boot/periodic reconcile** (reattach live pods via sealed BYOK; fail-closed only when unreattachable — `control_plane_restart` / `harness_detached`; `GET /v1/submissions/{id}/logs`), epoch-close batched D24 leaf emission with **WTA** (`prism-emit` outbox: `emitted_epoch` watermark + `prism_emit_cursor` + positive-score carry + `apply_wta`, migration 0012). `PRISM_MAX_CONCURRENT_EVALS` default/prod = 8. |
| prism recipe v1 | done | `prism-recipe` contract, fineweb-edu pinned shard (URL + SHA-256, harness re-verifies), 6h train / 7h pod caps, baseline sources, recipe pin hex on the API. |
| prism v3 harness | done (branch `prism-better`) | Multi-file harness package (`main.py` + `prismlib/`, miner code in `unshare --net` subprocess), seeded train stream with authoritative token counter, G6 probes, `prismlib/cheatguard.py` AST audit, METRICS_JSON v2, miner-chosen tokenizer, G5 RULER/BABILong/natural (pretrain-only), `RECIPE_VERSION 1.4.0`. |
| prism v3 eval battery | done (branch `prism-better`) | G1–G8 under `harness/eval/` (intrinsic, downstream, recall, reasoning, long-context, curve, inference, stability) + `eval/public_dev/` anchors family + `tests/smoke_battery.py`. |
| prism v3 two-phase pod flow | done (branch `prism-better`) | `PHASE_TRAIN_DONE` marker → post-train staging of private assets + secret seed (SSH on Lium, dir on Sim) → `.ready` gate (fail-closed) → eval phase. Private tier recorded as `eval_tier`. |
| prism v4 G2 benchmark leaf | **live default** | `PRISM_SCORING_MODE=benchmarks` (default) → equal-weight G2 public accuracies → `scoring_version` 4; never falls back to bits/token bpb. `prism-challenge rescore-g2` rewrites historical rows from stored `metrics_json`. |
| prism v3 composite scoring | done, opt-in | `prism-pipeline::composite` + `ScoringMode::Composite` (`PRISM_SCORING_MODE=composite` → `scoring_version` 3). Orchestrator persists the battery via `EvalStore`; parameter-cap breach is terminal `Score(0)` (`CAP_EXCEEDED`). |
| prism v3 eval store + Zone B | done (branch `prism-better`) | Migration 0017 (7 tables), `prism_store::eval::EvalStore`, memory + Postgres impls (`prism-eval-store`), composite finalization glue, `prism-zoneb` contract types; Zone B validated, labelled, never scored. |
| prism v3 attribution | done (branch `prism-better`) | `prism_recipe::attribution` 2×2 matrix builder + `POST /v1/submissions/{id}/attribution` returning run plans as JSON (operator-triggered execution); the route lives in `crates/prism-attribution` (split for the per-crate LOC cap). |
| prism v3 baselines | done (branch `prism-better`) | `crates/prism-recipe/baselines/` Transformer++ + hybrid delta reference trees embedded as `prism_recipe::baselines`; G1 scored keys promoted to tokenizer-neutral `org.g1.bits_per_byte_*`; `harness/eval/calibrate_anchors.py` fills references from baseline METRICS; numeric refs in `anchors/v0.json` remain **placeholder** until E6 GPU measurement + pre-registration. |
| prism top-model weights | done (branch `prism-better`) | Post-eval **secure receive** (master SSH pull → allowlisted stage + `RECEIPT.json`); admin `POST /v1/admin/artifacts/{id}/receive` for re-stage; publish verifies receipt (`PRISM_TOPMODEL_REQUIRE_WEIGHTS=1` fail-closed) + Release `prism-top-model`. |
| prism playground API | done (branch `prism-better`) | `POST /v1/admin/playground/complete` (admin Bearer) returns text + logprobs against parked top/specified checkpoint; journals to `{artifact_dir}/playground_journal.jsonl`; Sim stubs return structured diagnostics without pretending to infer. |
| prism inference traces | done (branch `prism-better`) | Battery G2–G5 persist prompt/choices/gold/selected/logprobs (G1 excerpts) in METRICS_JSON `inference_traces` (size-capped); `GET /v1/submissions/{id}/inference` paginated complete-view. |
| prism LLM review | done | `prism-review` quality + similarity-v3 prompts (versioned), OpenRouter client (key file only, never env), deterministic sim fallback; cheap `Copied` hard-zeros; cheap `Suspicious` hard-zeros only at `score ≥ 0.9` with non-trope evidence (`SUSPICIOUS_HARD_ZERO_THRESHOLD`); generic LM tropes coerced; copy/similarity/agentic corpus = champions (Score>0) + baseline. |
| prism API | done | Full status surface: submissions list/detail/events/status/jobs/recipe/baseline, idempotent accept, advisory `/precheck`; v3: `metrics?zone=a\|b`, `/inference`, `/anchors`, `/preregistration`, `/attribution`; admin Bearer on retry / gating reset / playground. |
| Phala / agent-v1 miner path | removed | External miners use HTTP submit only ([`external-miner/`](external-miner/)). |

## Known gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| DCAP verify holds the attest mutex | A cold Intel PCS fetch (up to 20 s) serialises attestation submissions. |
| DCAP error classification | Matches on `anyhow` message text; re-run `cargo test -p attest-policy --features dcap` after any `dcap-qvl` bump. |
| Design compose/images | deploy-wiring in progress; local port `28093` documented. |
| Design emission ceremony | Emission disabled (0 bps); prism at 100% (10000 bps). Optional prod `design_sk` / owner key rotation still pending. |
| Mainnet (netuid 100) | Owner wallet not yet on this machine, so prod runs with `BASE_GATEWAY_REQUIRE_OWNER=0`. |
| Prod pin placeholders | `deploy/pins/prod.json` still ships zero-digests until the first successful promote; registry mode rejects placeholders. |
| Spaces backup secrets | First prod promote is fail-closed without `BASE_BACKUP_ENDPOINT` + `SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (or AWS_* fallbacks) in GitHub. |
| GitHub `production` environment | Enable required reviewers (and branch protection on `main` as desired) before relying on tag-driven prod; workflow already sets `environment: production`. |
| TLS ACME | Ports 80/443 open on the firewall; gateway TLS termination not shipped yet. |
