//! `GET /v1/weights/latest` response shape served by the master gateway.
//!
//! This is a drop-in projection of the Python master's `MasterWeightsResponse`
//! (`src/base/schemas/weights.py`): identical field names, types and semantics,
//! plus the two Rust-only extras (`merkle_root`, `final_vector`) that the
//! validator already consumes, so the body stays a strict superset.
//!
//! Sealed fields are derived from the [`EpochBundleV1`] and the seal record
//! captured by the bundle store at seal time. When no sealed bundle is available
//! (or decode fails), the gateway serves [`build_burn_fallback`] — uid 0 at 100%
//! under `burn-uid0.v1` — rather than 404, so validators never see an empty
//! weights endpoint. That fallback is a **label**, not a miner payout: validators
//! must not Match or submit it. Submitting `burn-uid0.v1` pays the registered
//! owner (UID 0 is the owner+validator hotkey on this subnet) — that is the bug.
//!
//! HTTP serve applies [`refresh_serve_freshness`] so wall-clock fields stay
//! inside the Python client's pydantic / stale checks even when the underlying
//! seal is older than [`FRESHNESS_SECONDS`] (immutable seal content unchanged).
